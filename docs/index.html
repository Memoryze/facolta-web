				<p class="intro">
					Facolta is designed to help upskill both teachers and non-teachers
					with the necessary skill to enable them seamlessly share their
					knowledge to students and make money while at it.

				<h2 class="about-us-heading">About us</h2>
				<p class="about-us-par">
					At Facolta, we believe everyone has something they are good at or very
					knowledgeable about. This is even more true when a person works as an
					educator. However, there seems to be a gap between knowing about a
					thing and being able to educate another person about it.
				</p>
				<p class="about-us-par">
					In a bid to bridge this gap, we decided to create a free
					student-focused teaching curriculum with content collated from the
					different corners of the Web. This curriculum is a bit unconventional
					as it combines blog posts, podcast episodes, videos, and articles. You
					lean how to become a better teacher and how to make money while at it.
				</p>
				<p class="about-us-par">
					We also have a Slack community where educators from across the world
					interact, network and share life-changing tips and experiences. As an
					educator, you will have access to a goldmine of information with which
					you can take your career to the next level.
